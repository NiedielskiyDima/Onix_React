                        Functionality is given a special role. But it is not dominant in interior design. Unlike hi-tech and futurism, modern style is based on comfort, coziness, and convenience. 
                        That is why the apartment is equipped with appliances to the maximum, but at the same time, newfangled devices are not put on display. More often they are carefully built into furniture structures with sliding systems.
